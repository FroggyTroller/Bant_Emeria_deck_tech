		<br>
		<p>Emeria is an archtype in the Modern format based around stalling the game and using creatures with enter-the-battlefield synergy to grind out the game.<br>This strategy is based around the cards Emeria, the Sky Ruin, and Sun Titan to help recur creatures and provide value. Emeria decks always contain white,<br>but often splash more colors. A blue/white version of Emeria will usually be a tap-out control style deck. A green/white would be a much more aggressive,<br>ramp-based deck. Some will even go white/blue/red to play Saheeli Rai, allowing for multiple combos and countless syngeries. Bant Emeria contains white,<br>blue, and green. The green provides much more graveyard synergy, while the blue splash gives a bit more consistency and removal.</p>
