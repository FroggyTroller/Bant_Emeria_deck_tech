		<h1>Bant Emeria mana base</h1>
		<a href="DECK_TECH-USE_ONLY.html">back to hub</a>
		<br>
		<p>Emeria decks typically run well with 22-25 lands, depending on the style (a green/white list would run less because it has ramp, while a blue/white list<br>would run more due to it's control aspects). The main problem with making a three-colored Emeria deck is the mana base. You need to be able to get all<br>of your colors, while not interfering with the number of plains to let Emeria trigger. This can be a major deckbuilding restriction because it means that a classic<br>fetch/shock/fast land mana base won't cut it. With that said, this is my Bant Emeria mana base:
		<div style="color:green">
		<ul>
			<li>4x Emeria, the Sky Ruin</li>
			<li>2x Flooded Strand</li>
			<li>2x Windswept Heath</li>
			<li>1x Canopy Vista</li>
			<li>2x Prairie Stream</li>
			<li>1x Irrigated Farmland</li>
			<li>1x Scattered Groves</li>
			<li>2x Ghost Quarter</li>
			<li>1x Island</li>
			<li>1x Forest</li>
			<li>6x Plains</li>
		</ul>
		</div>
		<p>This list is running 23 lands. There are only four fetchlands; 2 each of Windswept Heath and Flooded Strand. There is no need for shock lands because<br>the battle lands are even better with the amount of basics we are running. Because Bant is a shard, it has two potential battle lands, and we are running 2<br>Prairie Stream and 1 Canopy Vista. The bicycle lands from Amonkhet are helpful because along with being able to be fetched up, they can be cycled<br>only to be recurred with a Renegade Rallier or a Sun Titan. Those creatures could also get back Ghost Quarters, which after enough grinding can lead<br>to them becoming strip mines against most modern decks. Since we are in three colors, we are only running two Ghost Quarters, but in two or even<br>mono-white colors, a playset is usually played.</p>
